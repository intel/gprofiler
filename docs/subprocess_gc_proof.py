Proof that Python GC cannot automatically clean up subprocess pipes.

This script demonstrates the layered nature of the problem:
- Python GC operates on objects
- OS resources (file descriptors) are invisible to GC
- Manual cleanup is required for proper resource management

Run this to see the evidence that led to gprofiler's memory leak fix.
